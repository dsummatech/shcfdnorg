= A NOTE FROM OUR FOUNDER —
DEAR FRIENDS,

As the founder of the Stone of Hope Children Foundation, | am overwhelmed with a mix of emotions as | reflect on our
journey thus far. The path we have embarked upon, with the aim of educating, feeding, and nurturing orphans and less
privileged individuals in Ejeme Aniogor, Delta State, Nigeria, and beyond, has been both challenging and immensely
rewarding.

When we first started this foundation, the plight of these vulnerable children and individuals weighed heavily on my heart.
Their innocence and untapped potential compelled me to take action and create a haven where they could find hope, love,
and opportunities for a brighter future. The Stone of Hope Children Foundation became that beacon of light, offering
education, nourishment, and a nurturing environment to those who needed it most.

The countless stories of transformation we have witnessed are testaments to the power of compassion and the impact we
can make when we come together. Every child who has found solace in our classrooms, every mouth we have fed, and
every life we have touched reaffirms our mission and ignites a fire within our hearts.

But, dear supporters, our work is far from over. There are still countless children yearning for an education, individuals
longing for a meal, and dreams waiting to be nurtured. It is only through your continued support and generosity that we
can reach out to more lives, extend our reach, and break the cycle of poverty and despair.

Together, let us be the guiding stones of hope in the lives of these children and less privileged individuals.

Your contributions, whether big or small, have the power to transform their lives and give them a chance at a brighter
future. Join us as we strive to make a lasting impact, not only in Ejeme Aniogor but also in communities beyond, for the
ripple effect of our work knows no bounds.

With heartfelt gratitude and a renewed commitment to our cause,

RITA ENUECHIE
FOUNDER- STONE OF HOPE CHILDREN FOUNDATION
